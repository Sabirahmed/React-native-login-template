# React-native-login-template

I have used Expo for development. Here I have used every navigator option available and combine them in a single project to create a seemless user navigation experience for the app user.

Then I have created simple template such as login, signup & splash screen and provided an authentication flow using AsycStorage. 
Also I have created form validation.
